# 310CT Intelligent Agents CW

A program written in [JAM Agent](http://www.marcush.net/IRS/Jam/Jam-man-01Nov01-draft.htm) (intelligent agent/AI) that simulates a Mar rover trying to find water on mars while avoiding rocks.

## Motivation

To write an Intelligent Agent using JAM Agent that can decide on how to navigate the surface of mars. This was made for my Intelligent Agent coursework written on [JAM Agent](http://www.marcush.net/IRS/Jam/Jam-man-01Nov01-draft.htm) which is a declarative language designed for writting Intelligent Agends and Artificial Intelligent.
